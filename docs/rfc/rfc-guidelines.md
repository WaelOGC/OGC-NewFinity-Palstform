# RFC Guidelines — OGC NewFinity Platform

These rules govern how RFCs must be created, reviewed, and approved.

---

## 1. When to Create an RFC

An RFC is required when:

- Introducing a new core service

- Changing existing architecture

- Modifying API structures

- Updating data models

- Adding new phases or diagram categories

- Introducing new governance rules

- Changing wallet or blockchain workflows

---

## 2. RFC Structure

All RFCs must follow:

docs/rfc/rfc-template.md

---

## 3. Review Process

1. Draft RFC  

2. Submit for internal review  

3. Architecture owner approves or rejects  

4. If approved → update diagrams + documentation  

5. Log the RFC in docs/changelog.md  

---

## 4. Naming Convention

RFC files must follow:

`rfc-<number>--<short-title>.md`

Example:

rfc-001--unified-wallet-service.md

---

## 5. Required Documentation Updates

After approval:

- Update Mermaid diagrams  

- Update related documentation  

- Update manifest  

- Add a changelog entry  

---

## 6. Prohibited Practices

- Do not bypass RFCs for major changes  

- Do not modify architecture without approval  

- Do not skip diagram updates

# Standardized Diagrams — OGC NewFinity

This folder contains the **official, standardized diagrams** used across all OGC NewFinity documentation.

## Purpose

These diagrams serve as the **single source of truth** for:
- Roadmap visualization
- Ecosystem architecture
- Token lifecycle
- Challenge Program flows
- Platform architecture

## How to Use

1. **Import into Markdown files:**
   ```markdown
   ```mermaid
   !include mermaid/00-standardized/roadmap-standardized.mmd
   ```
   ```

2. **Or copy the diagram code directly** into your markdown file.

3. **Ensure consistency:** Always use these standardized versions instead of creating new variations.

## Naming Conventions

All standardized diagrams follow this naming:
- `*-standardized.mmd` — Official standardized version
- Use exact terminology:
  - "OGCFinity" (not "OGC Token" or "OGC Currency")
  - "Innovation & Sustainability Challenge Fund"
  - "Contribution-Based Mining"
  - "OGC Vault"
  - "OGC Chain (Future)"

## Maintenance

- **Do NOT modify** these standardized diagrams without approval
- **Do NOT create** alternative versions
- **Always reference** these files when creating new documentation

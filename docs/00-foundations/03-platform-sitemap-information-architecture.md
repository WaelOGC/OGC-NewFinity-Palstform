# OGC NewFinity — Platform Sitemap & Information Architecture (v1.0)



## 1. Introduction

This document defines the full sitemap, information hierarchy, navigation logic, and platform-wide IA structure for OGC NewFinity. It ensures consistency across UI/UX design, development, and future scalability.



The IA is divided into four primary platform surfaces:

1. **Public Website (WordPress)**  

2. **Core Platform (React + Vite)**  

3. **Wallet Dashboard**  

4. **Amy Agent Dashboard**



Each surface has its own navigation structure but follows a unified experience model.

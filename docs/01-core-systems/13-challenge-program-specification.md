# OGC NewFinity — Challenge Program Specification (v1.0)



## 1. Introduction

The OGC NewFinity Challenge Program is the competitive engine of the platform.  

It empowers users—students, freelancers, creators, and groups—to participate in structured challenges, submit creative or technical entries, vote on submissions, earn contributions, and win OGCFinity rewards.

**Fund Linkage**

The OGC NewFinity Challenge Program is funded directly by the Innovation & Sustainability Challenge Fund (20% – 100,000,000 OGCFinity). This allocation is part of the official Tokenomics model and supports grants, mentorship, tools, and ecosystem access for program participants.

**Token Integration**

The Challenge Program is a primary real-world utility driver of OGCFinity. Participants use OGCFinity for submissions, premium tools, evaluations, and advanced ecosystem access. Winners receive OGCFinity grants directly from the Innovation & Sustainability Challenge Fund.

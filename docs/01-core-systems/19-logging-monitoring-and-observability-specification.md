# OGC NewFinity — Logging, Monitoring & System Observability Specification (v1.0)



## 1. Introduction

This document defines the logging, monitoring, and observability strategy for the OGC NewFinity ecosystem.  

It ensures the platform remains stable, traceable, debuggable, auditable, and scalable.



This is the master reference for backend developers, DevOps engineers, SRE teams, and future governance modules.

# 2. Observability Goals



The observability layer must enable:



- **Error tracking**  

- **Performance monitoring**  

- **Security audits**  

- **User behavior analytics**  

- **AI usage insights**  

- **Challenge program analytics**  

- **Wallet & token activity auditing**  

- **Admin activity oversight**  

- **API performance tracking**



The goal is to proactively detect issues before they impact users.

# 3. Logging Architecture



Logging is implemented across three layers:



### **3.1 Application Logs**

Generated by backend services:

- Auth events  

- API errors  

- Validation issues  

- Database exceptions  

- Business logic warnings  



### **3.2 AI Gateway Logs**

All AI interactions are logged:

- User ID  

- Tool used  

- Tokens consumed  

- Model response time  

- Metadata  



Stored in `ai_logs` table.



### **3.3 Admin Activity Logs**

Tracks high-privilege actions:

- Role changes  

- Challenge approvals  

- Badge assignments  

- Manual rewards  

- System configuration updates  



These logs are mandatory for governance.

# 4. Log Format & Structure



All logs follow a standardized JSON format:



{

"timestamp": "ISO8601",

"level": "info|warning|error|critical",

"service": "auth|wallet|ai|challenge|admin|subscription",

"message": "Readable message",

"user_id": "optional",

"metadata": { ... }

}



yaml

Copy code



### **Mandatory Fields**

- timestamp  

- level  

- service  

- message  



### **Optional Fields**

- user_id  

- metadata  



Metadata may include:

- request payload  

- IP address (masked)  

- response time  

- transaction ID

# 5. Log Levels



| Level | Description |

|------|-------------|

| **INFO** | Normal operations |

| **WARNING** | Something unusual, but system works |

| **ERROR** | Failed operation, needs developer review |

| **CRITICAL** | System failure, immediate intervention |



---



# 6. Monitoring Components



### **6.1 API Monitoring**

Tracks:

- Response times  

- Error rates  

- Downtime  

- Status codes  

- Endpoint latency distribution  



### **6.2 AI Monitoring**

Tracks:

- Model response times  

- Token usage spikes  

- Failed requests  

- Rate-limit triggers  



### **6.3 Wallet & Token Monitoring**

Tracks:

- Sync failure rates  

- Transaction mismatches  

- Suspicious token activity  

- Reward distribution errors  



### **6.4 Subscription Monitoring**

Tracks:

- Payment failures  

- Webhook mismatches  

- Renewal errors  



### **6.5 Challenge Monitoring**

Tracks:

- Submission volume  

- Vote patterns  

- Fraud detection signals  



---



# 7. System Alerts & Thresholds



### The system must generate alerts for:

- High API error rate  

- Excessive AI failure rate  

- Abnormal spike in transactions  

- Subscription payment failures  

- Challenge submission anomalies  

- Admin misuse signals  



### Alert Channels:

- Email  

- Internal admin notifications  

- Logging dashboard (future)  



---



# 8. Security, Privacy & Compliance



### **8.1 Sensitive Data Rules**

- Passwords NEVER logged  

- Full tokens NEVER logged  

- Wallet private keys NEVER stored  

- Personal data masked fully or partially  



### **8.2 Compliance**

Logs must follow:

- Data minimization principles  

- Access controls  

- Secure retention policies  



### **8.3 Log Access**

- Admin access limited  

- Only developers with clearance can access raw logs  

- All log access is itself logged  



---



# 9. Retention & Storage Policy



### **Retention Durations**

- Application logs: 90 days  

- AI logs: 180 days  

- Admin logs: 1 year  

- Security logs: indefinitely (encrypted)



### **Storage Requirements**

- Encrypted at rest  

- Encrypted in transit  

- Partitioned by date  

- Indexed for fast queries  



Future: Dedicated log storage cluster.

# 10. Future Observability Roadmap



- Full monitoring dashboard  

- Real-time performance visualization  

- AI model health monitoring  

- ML-based anomaly detection  

- Error heatmaps  

- Predictive alerting engine  

- On-chain analytics dashboards  



---



# 11. Conclusion

This specification defines the logging, monitoring, and observability foundation for the OGC NewFinity ecosystem.  

It ensures reliability, security, traceability, and informed decision-making for all future scaling efforts.
